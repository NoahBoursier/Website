                                I have taken two computer science classes and a general engineering class 
								(Principles of Engineering) at Dublin High School as part of an engineering 
								pathway and am currently taking a course about digital electronics as a senior.
                                I am artistic, analytical, stable, realistic, rational, resourceful and creative. 
                                I use the new things I learn in my projects and endeavors all the time.

                                Though my family is big into windsurfing, at the beach you are much more 
								likely to find me digging swaths of interconnected holes rather than playing 
								out on the water. At home I'll lose track of time while building with legos or 
								working on robots. Though I may not always have tools or materials, I will always 
								find a way to create. I have come to see every limitation of resources is an 
								opportunity for resourcefulness. I have worked with wood, metal, glass, software, 
								etc.

                                I enjoy designing and building, and have experience with a variety of tools.

								a bow, a little mechanism that launches quarters, traps, cardboard fortresses, all 
								kinds of art, computers, a tree house, robots, videogames with various engines, etc...

                            I like a wide range of music, I mean <i>really</i> wide. I'm French, Spanish, German, 
                            Czech and Dutch. If I could be fluent in any language it would be Chinese. I love
                            to build stuff out of junk, it is so much more satisfying to live frugally. I enjoy 
                            tree and rock climbing. I love all of God's creatues.
