                                I have taken two computer science classes and a general engineering class 
								(Principles of Engineering) at Dublin High School as part of an engineering 
								pathway. I am artistic, analytical, stable, realistic, rational, resourceful 
								and creative. I use the new things I learn in my projects and endeavors all 
								the time.

                                Though my family is big into windsurfing, at the beach you are much more 
								likely to find me digging swaths of interconnected holes rather than playing 
								out on the water. At home I'll lose track of time while building with legos or 
								working on robots. Though I may not always have tools or materials, I will always 
								find a way to create. I have come to see every limitation of resources is an 
								opportunity for resourcefulness. I have worked with wood, metal, glass, software, 
								etc.

                                I enjoy designing and building, and have experience with a variety of tools. 
								I've created a crossbow with a trigger system out of a heavy duty cardboard pipe, 
								a bow, a little mechanism that launches quarters, traps, cardboard fortresses, all 
								kinds of art, computers, a tree house, videogames with various engines, etc...

                                I feel like I could do anything if I put my mind to it, the only limiting factor

                            I like a wide range of music, I mean <i>really</i> wide. I love mexican and italian

							feel of fluffy jackets and temperate mornings. I enjoy tree and rock climbing. I 
							have caught and released countless snakes, lizards, and frogs.
