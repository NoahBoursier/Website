                                        My highschool robotics team (number 5327) partcipates in the international Vex Robotics Competition. Our school has 5 teams every year, four competition teams and one 'dev' or development team which is where newcomers to the club can learn the basics of Vex, programming, wiring, and simple machines. I skipped over dev team and have been on two different teams from my highschool: 5327W, which went to state and then world championships, winning multiple awards, and 5327C, which went to state championships and won multiple excellence awards - the highest award that can be recieved at a competition.

                                        In robotics I often led groups of other students in the assembly of robots and their components. I find that being well rounded in engineering, having a solid understanding of the software, electrical and hardware aspects of the robot, helps me immensely when working with a group as I know what to expect from each division. Though a lot of robotics is engineering know how, more important is one's ability to communicate well and work with others. I am grateful to have learned this somewhat early on. I admit I got a little obsessive, I would spend hours a day, often every day of the week, doing anything I could related to robotics. I just love to see a well made machine.

                                        Though I spent most of my time working with the teams I was on, I also aided in educating those on the development team, teaching about gear ratios, torque, levers, code logic, how to avoid high friction, and so on.

                                        In order to have a reliable and competition ready robot, a lot of testing, experimentation and prototyping is required. First we prototype to create the physical mechanisms and test those, then we program and test our robot’s autonomous features, later we do stress testing for competition scenarios, and so on. Even with all that to do it can be hard for everyone in a team to participate because you can only have so many people working on the robot at once. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                        In a team as large as ours (our school wants us to have at least ten members) participation was becoming a problem, especially with the newer members, so I established a research and development division for my robotics team. In which members of the team could work on something else if there are too many people already working on the robot. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                        Along with prototyping new designs alongside the robot, I would organize ‘skunk works’ side projects related to robotics for our R&D division. For example, a project that our research and development division embarked upon was the creation of a compact and mobile battery charging box, complete with two fans for cooling the batteries and digital voltmeters that will tell us the charges of the batteries. You can see a picture of that here: <a rel="gallery2" class="fancybox" href="files/Images/BattBox.jpg">View Image</a>. Another project was a Vex online challenge in which we were tasked with disassembling and researching all the components in an electronic device. (See that project’s documentation: <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PM5-jHZVlZ_XxalGz7b7_XINsPMSx0Ht" target='new'>Link</a>). I admit I messed around a little in the R&D division but I think it increased team moral and inspired team members to explore new ideas.

                                        Because our teams are based in the bay area, home of multiple world champions, we have to make our robots suited for competition against the worlds best. Every competition we go to the was always a former world champion present and it is all the more exciting when you triumph over them.
