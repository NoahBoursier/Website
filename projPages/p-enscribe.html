                                Inspired by something my coding class instructor said about hiding information in images using RGB values, I decided 
                                to make a program in Python that hides messages in images. It does this by taking a user input of a message, 
                                slightly modifying the last 2 binary digits of the RGB values of the picture to make the message. The software 
                                also allows the user to decode the encoded images.
                            </p>

                                The first step Enscribe takes to encode an image uses an algorithm I made to convert R, G, and B (each pixel of an image can be represented with three values red, green, and blue, these tell the computer what intensity of color should be displayed) integer values to binary, so it converts integers 0 to 255 into values 00000000 to 11111111. Because the last two digits in binary represent a total difference of 3 in the integer value 0 to 255, if I only modify the last two digits of the binary value there won't be a visible difference in the encoded image. Now by converting to binary I have access to a total of six digits, because I'm modifying the last two digits for three 0 to 255 values, one for each R, G and B. Now with six binary digits, meaning six zeros or ones, I can make a total of sixty four combinations using a technique similar to binary, but limited to 6 digits instead of 8. It is sixty four combinations because it the integer values I can get from six binary digits range from 0 to 63 (Ex: 000001 = 1, 000010 = 2, 000100 = 4, 111111 = 63). At the top of the picture to the left is a library, a useful Python list that allows me to link certain values to characters as you may be able to see, I have every character on the keyboard mapped out to a value ranging from 0 to 63, giving me a maximum of 64 characters. I found the maximum underwhelming, considering that a typical keyboard has around one hundred characters, like uppercase letters and symbols. So I created a solution by assigning each of the 64 slots two characters, one that is the default and then one that, if detected, will add in a '`' after the character. This character tips off the decoder that the character should be its second setting, for letters, uppercase, for numbers, symbols. You may have noticed that there is a set of 3 values in the library for each character set, each ranging from 0 to 3, 0 meaning both binary digits are 0, 1 meaning the first is 1 and the second is 0, 2 means the opposite of 1, and 3 means both digits are 1. This is just useful for the decoder algorithm.
