                                    Since the beginning of memory my family has been going camping in Sherman Island during the summer, we go every weekend to do watersports like windsurfing and kiting. The kids of the windsurfing and kiting community there are like a third set of cousins to me. However, when I go to Sherman Island, I'm not excited to go windsurfing or kiting, I'm excited to scavenge for tree house parts on the bank of the Sacramento River. We find all sorts of odds and ends washed up, but the occasional board or sheet of plywood are my favorite finds.

                                    I have added various improvements, such as a cabinet, some carpeting, a couch, shelves, a buoy 'bean bag chair', a lockable door, safety rails, a tarp roof and walls supported by bamboo, a massive westward windblock made of a part of a boat, and so much more.

                                    Occasionally my friends would join me in my architectural endeavors, for example I built the eastward door with my friend Mira. I planned out how to cut up a plywood so that it could be both a door frame and door, and then Mira aided with the cutting and installment. We originally used rope to make the hinges, and they worked surprisingly well.
