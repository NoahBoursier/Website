                                    During the summer following my sophomore year in highschool I worked at a local automotive repair shop. 
									I helped out with whatever I could and was often left on my own for tasks such as 
									changing oil and dismantling / re-assembling car components.

                                    While working for Dave, my boss at Broadway Motor and Muffler, I learned a fair amount 
									about what goes into making cars tick. I learned about differentials, transmissions, catalytic 
									converters, different types of engines, measurements for bolts and more. However not all of what I 
									learned is only applicable to cars, I also developed a superior work ethic while working for 
									Dave. I remember coming to him and asking for help and him responding: 
								</p >
								<blockquote class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                    "I don't pay you to bring me problems, I pay you for solutions!"
                                </blockquote>
								<p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
									Though his tone was lighthearted, this really spoke to me. His attitude during 
									my time working there was one that promoted my ability to solve problems independently, and as a 
									lead builder in my robotics club, I can relate with Dave. I don't have time for people to look for 
									the easy solution by asking questions that they could probably figure out the answer to if they tried.
                                </p>
                                <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".9s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
									Sometimes while working in the garage I could relate to those who have repetitive factory jobs. There 
									were days where all I would do is clean, sort bolts, and crush oil filters. I can't imagine staying sane 
									doing the same task over and over day after day. One day I spent a good eight hours crushing oil filters. 
									Every day I would come home with black hands and a face smeared with oil and god knows what else. I 
									didn't mind, I thought it was pretty fun. I had less free time over that summer than over my sophomore year.
