                                A requirement for Biology with Research, a class I took in my Freshman year, was to enter into the Alameda County Science Fair. My friends Uday, Gustavo and I wanted to do a project related to engineering, and a problem we thought of was accidental overdose on medication.

                                So we developed DoseMaster: a pill dispenser, reminder, and organizer for the forgetful. 
                            </blockquote>

                                We made a working prototype using an Arduino Mega microcontroller. The price of DoseMaster is only about sixty dollars for the materials and could probably sell at a reasonable price of 80 to 100 dollars, as compared to other household pill systems on the market which range from 400 to 800 dollars. The DoseMaster is intended for use in the home of a person with memory issues who needs medication, a caretaker or family member would only need to stock the machine once every month and then the machine would do the rest, alerting the patient, and ensuring that the pills were taken on time. To build DoseMaster my team and I had to utilize our understanding of digital electronics, mechanical engineering, and programming. in DoseMaster 2.0, depicted to the left, we utilize a solenoid puncher that reliably dispenses one pill at a time, a number pad and touchscreen for user input, an IR sensor to detect when a pill has been loosed, a huge piezo buzzer, and a plexiglass frame.

                                DoseMaster won first place in the mechanical engineering category at the Alameda County Science Fair and we then went on to present it in three other technology showcases where it received positive feedback from onlookers.

                                We also entered DoseMaster in our school entrepreneurship fair in which it won the ‘maker award’ as we were the only group with a working prototype.
