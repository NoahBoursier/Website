                                In my senior digital electronics class I was tasked with designing and creating a printed circuit board. I knew what needed to be done: an obnoxious buzzer. 
                            </p>

                                The circuit I designed is a delay with an alarm. It can be used as a distraction, prank, timer, or just to annoy someone. After flipping the toggle switch 
                                the circuit will wait about 12 seconds and then begin beeping and flashing. In order to be used in as many situations as possible I made the PCB very small. 
                                It also runs a blue LED in parallel with the piezo buzzer to be as alarming as possible. 
                            </p>

                                The process of making the PCB (printed circuit board) was less painful for me than my classmates probably because I used such a small piece of copper backed 
                                board. Because my circuit was as condensed as possible I did not need to wait as long for the etching process, which is when the excess copper not used in 
                                the circuit is chemically removed from the board. I also took extreme care to do things right the first time, as de-soldering or fixing a botched PCB are 
                                not fun activities.
