                                    In my highschool engineering class, following creating an actual solar and hydrogen powered car model with Vex, my classmates and I were individually tasked with creating a netlogo simulation that would simulate how our cars would operate with differing numbers of solar and or hydrogen cells.

                                    Though it was only required to make a simple simulation in which the speed of an object moving across the screen changes based on the amount of solar or hydrogen cells, I went above and beyond and tried to let the user modify as many variables as I could. On top of this I tried to make my program as bug free and as visually appealing as possible. I got a full score and extra credit on the project, as I went above and beyond in simulating the physics of a Vex hydrogen and or solar powered vehicle.
