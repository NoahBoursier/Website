                                As a freshman in highschool I applied for the school's engineering academy, a program that not only offers many different STEM related field trips for students, but also brings in industry mentors for students to develop communication and networking skills with. 
                            </p>

                                On academy field trips I toured a DOW chemical plant, a power plant, the Patriot Jet Team hangar, the Lawrence Lievermore National Ignition Facility, a water treatment plant, and more. 
                                The purpose of these trips is to expose us to a range of fields of engineering, and give us a glimpse of life in the work force. I found them to be quite interesting, and they solidified my
                                interest in having a career in engineering.
                            </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                As well as field trips the academy has a mentorship program in which each student is paired with an industry professional from a field of engineering usually related to the students interest. I was paired with Greg Tietbohl from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) National Ignition Facility (NIF). I communicated with Greg during meetings, and via email about robotics, colleges and often talked to him about his experience in the field. I learned what to do and what not to do when it comes to writing emails, applying for jobs, and general etiquette. 
                            </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".9s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                The academy has also brought in dozens of guest speakers. Two particularly memorable ones include a software developer from uber, who demonstrated very clearly how a neural network works to identify images, and an electrical engineer from Sandia who developes control systems for counter ballistic missiles. I found the exposure to the working world and cutting edge systems to be motivational, as almost every guest speaker who came in seemed to be doing something interesting, something I would like to do.
