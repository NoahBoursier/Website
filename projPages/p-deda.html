                                As a freshman in highschool I applied for the school's engineering academy, a program that not only offers many different STEM related field trips for students, but also brings in industry mentors for students to develop communication and networking skills with.

                                On academy field trips I toured a DOW chemical plant, a power plant, the Patriot Jet Team hangar, the Lawrence Lievermore National Ignition Facility, a water treatment plant, and more. 
                                The purpose of these trips is to expose us to a range of fields of engineering, and give us a glimpse of life in the work force. I found them to be quite interesting, and they solidified my
                                interest in having a career in engineering.

                                As well as field trips the academy has a mentorship program in which each student is paired with an industry professional from a field of engineering usually related to the students interest. I was paired with Greg Tietbohl from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) National Ignition Facility (NIF). I communicated with Greg during meetings, and via email about robotics, colleges and often talked to him about his experience in the field. I learned what to do and what not to do when it comes to writing emails, applying for jobs, and general etiquette.
