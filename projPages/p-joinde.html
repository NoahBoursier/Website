                                In my senior digital electronics class I was put in a group and tasked with creating a display that cycles through states with 8 seven segment displays.
                                I played a lead role in the process, and due to our team's divide and conquer stragety and good work ethic we were able to get our project done first, 
                                and with good quality.
                            </p>
							<p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                Rather than have a long message spread out over 4 states, we decided to have just one simple message that scrolls across the display, because it looks cool. The message we chose was "Join dE", the odd capitalization is due to the limits of a seven segment display. 
                            </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                The whole project was done in a sort of caveman fashion, as was required. We made a binary count attached to a clock signal, and based on the two-bit binary combination (00,01,10,11) different segments on the displays would be light up, producing the message. This was all achieved with a three efficiently used NAND ICs (integrated circuits, the black bits near the bottom of left the picture) and a single flip flop IC (bottom right). The wires were color coded to aid in the assembly and debugging of our circuit.
