                                Ever since my friends and I were in middle school we have dreamed of finding an old iMac G3 to turn into an aquarium. 
                                Being PC building enthusiasts we thought it was a funny joke along the lines of:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                    "That's truly the best use for an Apple product, all they're good for really."
                            </blockquote>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                Though recently I've found that while Windows is great for many things, IOS can hold its own when it comes to quiting out of programs quickly, and my friend tells me that the Macs come with a superior BASH terminal.

                                In highschool my friends and I started the Tech Enthusiasts Club, a club dedicated to making wonderful and fun contraptions or helping other 
                                students pursue their own projects by lending them our engineering know how and experience with tools. Well before our 
                                schools club fair where we could advertise our club to the students, we found an old iMac at long last. 
                                We spent a day gutting it and making a special polycarbonate fish tank that would not only fit inside the frame of the iMac, but which also included
                                a curved front to match the original curve of the iMac's cathode ray tube screen. After gutting the Mac we put the internals back together 
                                and were able to get them working again, my little brother played Nanosuar (a game that is installed on iMac G3's by default) for a good while after that.
                                Once we finished the tank, we set up some RGB LEDs in the frame of the iMac to increase the cool factor by about 500%, LED lighting will do that.
                                The final touches included adding aquarium rocks to the tank and buying some cheap fake fish off amazon. We put an old water filter into the polycarb
                                tank to create a current for our plastic fish, which used the current to float about in a circle. As soon as we finished the macquarium we put it into 
                                our club advisors classroom as a gift, she was ecstatic.
