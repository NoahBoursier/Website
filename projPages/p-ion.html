                                One of the projects in my AP computer science applications class was to create an educational game using Java and android studio. My partner and
                                I decided to make an ion matching game for chemistry students in order to help them memorize the charges of common ions.
                            </p>

                                The game consists of a bunch of blocks that scroll slowly down the screen, each block is randomly arranged and is assigned an ion 
                                type, which in the code contains a charge value. The player is fed positive ions in the little square at the bottom of the screen.
                                The player's objective is to match up the given positive ions with the falling negative ions. By matching the charges the player 
                                causes the two to disappear and is fed a new positive ion. The objective is to last as long as you can without having the barrage
                                of negative ions reach the bottom of the screen.
                            </p>

                                My partner for this project was an experienced senior who is now attending UC Berkeley, so he wasn't much help at the time. 
                                I ended up doing the vast majority of the code for this project, and went to him for help when I hit problems. This was fine 
                                for me because I wanted more experience with Java anyway.
