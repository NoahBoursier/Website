                                The final project we had in AP computer science was to use what we had learned in the class to solve some issue of our choice. 
                                Because of my obsession with robotics I chose to do research on a new sensor by making a color tracking turret with a sensor 
                                very much like the one the robotics teams will be using next year.

                                To test the aiming capabilities of the Pixy camera I decided to design a launcher with aiming system that could change where the Pixy camera is looking as it moves about. The turret base has 360 degrees of freedom (not considering the turret rotation motor cables), and the launcher itself has 45 degrees of freedom when angling up and down. The launcher is a simple linear slide with rack and slip gear. It uses rubber bands to propel the ‘puncher’ forward into the ball after the slip gear has rotated so that the part with no teeth is on the rack, allowing the rack to fly forward.
