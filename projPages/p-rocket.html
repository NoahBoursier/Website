                                In my highschool general engineering class we were assigned a project in which our task was to create a rocket that would travel the greatest distance at the fastest speed using only paper and tape. I worked alongside some friends from the robotics club and our team built the three most successful rockets.
                            </p>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                After creating the rockets we would then launch them using compressed air released by an electronic solenoid valve. My team worked as a group to first test a multitude of different rocket designs utilizing wings, fins, and the lack of, to see how each factor affected the flight of the rocket. Then after we had tested our first rockets and saw what worked and what didn't, we built some rockets that shared the best qualities of each model in order to achieve the best flight and distance. My team had the top three performing rockets in the class, as ours had flown about the length of the football field and a half. One of them almost went into someones backyard.

                                While this project was going on Gustavo (a teammate and long time friend of mine) and I went to Byron Airport to see the Patriot Jet team. This field trip along with many others are at the courtesy and expense of our highschool's wonderful engineering academy. Anyway, we asked about the number of fins and the answer we got was basically:

                            <blockquote class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                "As few as possible while gaining the benefit of them."
                            </blockquote>
                            <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".5" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                                I interpreted this answer for our rocket as three. It makes sense, stabilization with as little drag as possible. If you just have two fins they could cause the rocket to be blasted back by a gust of air or otherwise be asymmetrical.
